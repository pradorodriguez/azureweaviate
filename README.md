# Embeddings and semantic search best practices in a RAG pattern with Weaviate Vector DB in Azure

## Description:

This session will cover the technical aspects of embedding, chunking, and querying a Vector Database for developing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution with Azure OpenAI.

These components are crucial for high-quality LLM responses. We will address common confusion in the engineering field about best practices, algorithm selection for vector distances, querying the database, and formulating LLM prompts. A code example will be reviewed to implement effective RAG patterns.
